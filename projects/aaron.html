   Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy using Residual Learning with a Custom Balanced Loss
</div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to vision impairment or blindness, making early detection crucial. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with class imbalance in medical datasets, leading to poor performance for minority classes. This study proposes a novel deep learning model based on Residual Networks (ResNet) to address the multi-class classification of DR, with a focus on mitigating class imbalance. Standard Softmax activation functions tend to favor the majority classes, thereby worsening the model's performance on minority classes. To address this, the study incorporates a custom loss function, Balanced Softmax Loss, which adjusts class weights to improve the recognition of minority classes. Additionally, the model integrates advanced techniques such as Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, learnable wavelet transforms, and multi-head attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and model performance. The model was trained and evaluated on the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset, achieving a micro-average accuracy of 0.83 and a macro-average accuracy of 0.73 in the 5-class classification task. In a 4-class classification task, where severe and proliferative DR are merged, the model achieved a micro-average accuracy of 0.87 and a macro-average accuracy of 0.84. The model's interpretability was further enhanced through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as LIME, Grad-CAM, and SHAP. The trained model was deployed as a web-based application using Flask, enabling real-time classification of retinal images. The study highlights the model's effectiveness in addressing class imbalance and its potential for early DR diagnosis, thereby enhancing clinical decision support.</p>
