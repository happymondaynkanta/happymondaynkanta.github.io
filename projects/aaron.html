    Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy using Residual Learning with a Custom Balanced Loss
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a vision-threatening complication of diabetes that requires early and accurate diagnosis.
        This project introduces a novel Residual Network (ResNet)-based classification model with a custom Balanced Softmax Loss function 
        to improve performance on imbalanced medical datasets. Enhancements include the integration of Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, 
        learnable wavelet filters, and multi-head attention to boost feature discrimination. The model was evaluated using the APTOS 2019 dataset 
        and achieved strong results in both 5-class and 4-class DR classification tasks. Interpretability was ensured using XAI tools like 
        Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME. A web interface was developed for real-time diagnosis.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proposed a custom Balanced Softmax Loss to mitigate class imbalance in medical image classification.</li>
        <li>Integrated SE-blocks, wavelet transforms, and multi-head attention into a ResNet framework for superior feature extraction.</li>
        <li>Achieved 0.83 (5-class) and 0.87 (4-class) micro-accuracy on the APTOS dataset.</li>
        <li>Deployed an XAI-enabled Flask web app for real-time DR prediction and clinical interpretability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates how advanced network architecture and loss customization can significantly improve DR classification. 
        The integration of attention mechanisms and XAI tools makes the model both powerful and interpretable, offering practical support 
        to ophthalmologists in clinical settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation</h2>
    <p>
        The model's performance is constrained by the limited diversity of the dataset and may not generalize well to other populations or imaging devices. 
        Additionally, training deep architectures with balanced loss increases training complexity and time.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>
        Future improvements will involve training with multi-institutional datasets, including other eye conditions such as glaucoma or AMD.
        The integration of ensemble learning and semi-supervised approaches may further boost classification robustness and generalization.
