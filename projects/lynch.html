  Application of Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition using CIFAR-10 Dataset
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. By leveraging transfer learning through fine-tuning the VGG-16 model, the student developed a high-accuracy classifier. The model achieved 85% accuracy and was optimized by adjusting the last three fully connected layers. A graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library enables non-programmers to use the model for classification. Users can load a trained model, upload a 24-bit image, and receive classification results directly on the interface. This system aims to simplify the use of deep learning for general users while maintaining reliable recognition performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fine-tuned a VGG-16 CNN model using the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving 85% accuracy.</li>
    <li>Designed and implemented a user-friendly GUI for real-time image classification with Tkinter.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated the use of transfer learning by modifying only the last three layers of VGG-16.</li>
    <li>Applied model visualization and evaluation techniques including accuracy/loss plots using Matplotlib.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The modified VGG-16 model effectively classifies images in the CIFAR-10 dataset with high accuracy and reduced overfitting. Its integration into a GUI allows broader accessibility and usability for non-technical users. The application is suitable for educational and practical use in image classification tasks.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation</h2>
  <p>
    The model currently supports only 24-bit depth RGB images and may underperform on datasets with drastically different image characteristics. The reliance on VGG-16 and CIFAR-10 limits its adaptability without further training or domain-specific tuning.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    Planned enhancements include expanding the model‚Äôs compatibility to different image formats and bit depths, integrating other pre-trained models for comparative analysis, and deploying the tool as a web application to enhance accessibility. Additional work may include support for edge computing environments.
