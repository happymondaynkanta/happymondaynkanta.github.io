    Radiance Sky Image-based Cloud Shadow Mapping for Solar Energy Forecasting

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Accurate short-term solar energy forecasting is vital for efficient grid integration and operational planning in solar power systems. This study presents a hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, and an attention mechanism to enhance the prediction accuracy of solar irradiance. The model leverages spatial-temporal patterns extracted from cloud motion vectors, derived from satellite imagery and weather data, to forecast solar radiation, which directly correlates with energy output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. The proposed architecture begins with CNN layers that effectively capture spatial features from sequential sky images, particularly focusing on cloud dynamics that influence solar irradiance. These spatial representations are passed into BiLSTM layers to model temporal dependencies across consecutive time frames. To further refine the prediction capability, an attention mechanism is applied, allowing the model to weigh time steps according to their relevance to the final output, improving interpretability and focus on influential weather patterns. The model was trained on real-world solar and meteorological datasets, including irradiance, cloud cover, temperature, and wind metrics. Evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) confirmed the model’s superior performance over traditional LSTM and CNN-based baselines. Furthermore, the attention maps provided explainable insights into which time sequences and cloud movement features were most critical for accurate forecasts. The final system was deployed via a user-interactive dashboard that supports real-time input and visualization of forecasting outputs. This integration provides practical value for solar farm operators, offering actionable insights to optimize solar panel orientation and maximize energy capture. Overall, this research contributes a robust, interpretable, and deployable solution for short-term solar energy forecasting, advancing the capabilities of intelligent energy management in renewable systems.</p>
