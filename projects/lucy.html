  Faster R-CNN: Deep Learning-based Mask Wearing Detection in Public Spaces
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Since the COVID-19 outbreak, face masks have played a crucial role in preventing virus transmission in public spaces. This project applies Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 + FPN backbone to develop an efficient facemask detection system. The model was trained on a custom dataset with three classes‚Äîmask, no mask, and false mask‚Äîusing optimized hyperparameters (LR = 0.005, SGD). Evaluation on key metrics such as mAP, F1-score, and LAMR showed that the model achieved 98.40% mAP and nearly perfect detection for ‚Äúfalse mask‚Äù class. The system was deployed with a PyQt GUI that supports both image and video inputs.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a customized 3-class facemask detection dataset in Pascal VOC format with 3954 labeled images.</li>
    <li>Designed and evaluated four Faster R-CNN backbones: MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet50+FPN.</li>
    <li>Achieved highest performance using ResNet50+FPN (mAP = 98.40%) with optimized learning rate and SGD optimizer.</li>
    <li>Implemented interpretability via EigenCAM and AblationCAM to visualize model focus during prediction.</li>
    <li>Developed an intuitive GUI using PyQt with real-time mask detection in both image and video modes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project successfully demonstrates that Faster R-CNN with an enhanced backbone (ResNet50+FPN) is capable of accurately detecting mask-wearing status across various conditions. With robust performance and practical interpretability tools, the system offers real-world application potential in public health monitoring.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation</h2>
  <p>
    The system's video detection operates at a low frame rate (‚âà1.5 fps), limiting real-time deployment efficiency. Additionally, performance on diverse camera angles and lighting conditions may require further generalization.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    Planned improvements include optimizing real-time video processing using lighter models (e.g., YOLOv7), deploying on edge devices, and extending the system for additional PPE detection (gloves, face shields) using multi-label object detection.
