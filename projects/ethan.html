  <h1>Convolutional Neural Network Based Technique for Flower Classification</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Yang Haoyun (Ethan)</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This project explores flower image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly the VGG16 model. By training on the Oxford 17 flower dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 92.04%. The model architecture includes 13 convolutional layers, 5 pooling layers, and 3 fully connected layers followed by a softmax output. ReLU was used as the activation function, and SGD was employed for optimization.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>With increasing image data availability, efficient and accurate flower species classification is essential. Traditional manual feature extraction methods have limitations in accuracy and efficiency. Convolutional neural networks offer an automated approach to feature extraction, improving classification performance. VGGNet, developed by Oxford University, enhances classification through deeper layers and smaller convolutional kernels.</p>
