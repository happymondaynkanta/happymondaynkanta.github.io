    ECG-ECANet: Heart Disease Classification using Multimodal ECG Signals and Images
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>What is  ECG-ECANet?</h2>
    <p>ECG-ECANet is a specialized deep learning model developed to address the challenges of accurately detecting heart disease across various ECG datasets. It combines customized data processing techniques for both ECG signals and images, enabling it to handle the unique complexities of ECG data, particularly the multi-label classification issue. This issue arises when a single ECG sample exhibits features of multiple heart conditions. ECG-ECANet is designed not only to improve detection accuracy but also to provide interpretability, making its classification decisions transparent and understandable to clinicians, which supports their trust in using AI for heart disease diagnosis.</p>

    <h2>Why did we develop  ECG-ECANet?</h2>
    <p>This study tackles the complex challenge of accurately detecting heart disease across diverse ECG datasets by developing a specialized deep learning model called ECG-ECANet and custom data processing techniques for both ECG signals and images. A key focus is addressing the unique multi-label classification issue inherent in electrocardiograms, where a single ECG sample may contain indicators of multiple heart conditions. By implementing a range of interpretability analysis methods, the study aims to provide clinicians with clear, transparent insights into the CNN models' decision-making process, enhancing their confidence in using AI for heart disease diagnosis.</p>

    <h2>How did we collect and label the dataset for ECG-ECANet?</h2>
    <p>To prepare the dataset for ECG-ECANet, we utilized well-established ECG datasets, primarily the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and PTB-XL ECG dataset. 

    <h3>Collection and Labeling</h3>
    The <strong>MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database</strong> consists of 48 excerpts, each 30 minutes long, recorded from 47 subjects, including both inpatients and outpatients. These recordings were selected to represent both common and rare arrhythmias, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for training. Each recording was annotated with over 110,000 labels, and validated by cardiologists for accuracy, making it a reliable dataset for arrhythmia detection. The <strong>PTB-XL ECG dataset</strong> is a larger clinical dataset, containing 12-lead ECG recordings from 18,869 patients. Each 10-second recording includes labels based on SCP-ECG standards, covering diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements, thus enabling multi-label classification.

    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
    To make ECG data compatible with deep learning models, we applied several preprocessing techniques using the <strong>Pan Tompkins algorithm</strong>
    <div class="item list-item">
         <p><strong>Bandpass Filtering:</strong> This step isolates the QRS complexes by removing both low- and high-frequency noise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item list-item">
         <p><strong>Differentiation:</strong> This highlights the slopes of QRS complexes, emphasizing rapid changes in amplitude.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item list-item">
         <p><strong>Squaring:</strong> By squaring the differentiated signal, the high amplitude regions corresponding to QRS complexes are emphasized.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item list-item">
         <p><strong>Integration:</strong> A moving window integration is applied to further smooth the signal and highlight peaks, aiding in QRS complex detection.</p>
    </div>
  
    For data balance, we applied <strong>Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)</strong> to oversample underrepresented classes and downsample overrepresented classes. This resulted in a more balanced class distribution for model training.

    <h3>Feature Extraction and Transformation</h3>
    Given that different segments of the ECG waveform (e.g., P-wave, QRS complex, T-wave) contain critical diagnostic information, we leveraged <strong>wavelet transforms (CWT)</strong>  to extract features from various scales. Using a <strong>complex Morlet wavelet</strong>, we extracted multi-scale features from the ECG signals to provide a richer representation for classification tasks. Additionally, we implemented segmentation schemes for the 12-lead ECG data by dividing records into multiple image segments that retain essential waveform information without losing diagnostic details.

    <h3>Image Standardization and Augmentation</h3>
    For 12-lead ECG data, we converted signals into images, applying techniques such as <strong>standardization</strong> to adjust the amplitude range and maintain uniform data representation. We also experimented with image transformations, including color inversion, histogram equalization, and wavelet-based filtering. Data augmentation techniques, such as adjusting image brightness and contrast, further enriched the dataset, enhancing the robustness of ECG-ECANet.

    This comprehensive data collection, labeling, and processing pipeline ensures that ECG-ECANet can accurately detect and interpret heart disease indicators across a diverse range of ECG datasets, supporting complex, multi-label classification tasks.</p>
