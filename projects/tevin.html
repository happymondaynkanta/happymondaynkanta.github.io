  Self-driving Car in Video Game using Deep Learning Approach
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This project explores the development of a self-driving car system within the video game Grand Theft Auto V using a deep learning approach. Leveraging EfficientNetV2 with LSTM and Transformer encoders, the model was trained on gameplay image sequences and optimized through transfer learning. A GUI developed with Gradio allows users to visualize predictions and model behavior in real time. The model achieved over 70% accuracy on highway scenarios under clear daytime conditions. The system serves as a simulation platform for research, training, and educational purposes, demonstrating the feasibility of using video games to safely and cost-effectively test autonomous driving algorithms.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed a deep learning-based autopilot system using EfficientNetV2 with Transformer/LSTM encoders for GTA V.</li>
    <li>Generated training data via in-game behavior recording and built a custom dataset for transfer learning.</li>
    <li>Achieved over 70% accuracy in sunny highway conditions; implemented evaluation metrics such as micro and macro accuracy.</li>
    <li>Developed an interactive Gradio GUI for visualizing model performance and predictions per frame.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The self-driving simulation system demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning with gaming platforms for low-risk, low-cost testing of autonomous driving models. With transfer learning and optimized architecture configurations, the system achieves notable performance. The GUI extends accessibility to users lacking high-end hardware for real-time evaluation. However, real-world generalization requires additional sensors, richer datasets, and environmental modeling.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation</h2>
  <p>
    The trained model is constrained by the synthetic nature of the gaming environment and lacks exposure to complex real-world driving conditions. It cannot detect road compliance elements such as traffic lights or weather-based dynamics. Additionally, evaluation accuracy is bounded by the resolution and scope of the collected dataset.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    Future extensions include expanding model capabilities to detect traffic signs, handle adverse conditions, and integrate real-time sensor fusion. Enhanced realism via physics-based simulators and integration with multi-modal sensor data will be explored. Deployment to other gaming environments and online collaborative simulations is also envisioned.
