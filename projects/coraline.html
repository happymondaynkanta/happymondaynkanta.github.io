    <h1>Flower Image Recognition based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project by <strong>Xinyi Wang (Coraline)</strong> focuses on building a flower image recognition system using a deep learning model based on the ResNet-18 architecture.
            It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle consisting of 1,000 flower images across 10 categories. The images are classified using a convolutional neural network implemented with PyTorch,
            and the final application includes a GUI built with Tkinter for user interaction.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Highlights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Used ResNet-18 architecture trained with cross-entropy loss and optimized using Adam optimizer.</li>
            <li>Achieved 96% training accuracy and 84‚Äì86.8% validation accuracy.</li>
            <li>Built a GUI with Tkinter that allows image upload and classification display.</li>
            <li>Conducted evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset includes 1,000 flower images equally split into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets. Each image was resized to 256x256x3 for model compatibility.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>GUI Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            A three-step GUI was implemented to recognize and classify flowers. The user selects an image, views it, and receives a classification result with the flower name displayed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Some misclassifications occurred due to image quality and similarities among flower types. Future improvements could include larger and more diverse datasets, advanced CNN architectures,
            and edge deployment for mobile users.
